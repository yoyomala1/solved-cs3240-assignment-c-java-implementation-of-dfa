Develop a Java im plementation of the DFA class that exactly matches this <a href="http://jodypaul.com/cs/theory/DFAjava/DFA.html">posted API</a>. Note that this class must reside in the <em>unnamed</em> package, thus you must not use a package statement.

There is no user interface to this class. All access is via the specified public methods. Note in particular that System.out, System.err, and System.in must not be directly accessed by your program. Also note that there is no method with signature public static void main.

Your implementation must utilize the State class as defined in <a href="http://jodypaul.com/cs/theory/DFAjava/State.html">this API</a>.

For your convenience, I have provided Java <a href="https://gouda.msudenver.edu/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=8937">source code</a> for supporting and test classes. You should feel free to use this sample implementation of <a href="https://gouda.msudenver.edu/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=8937&amp;chapterid=89">State.java</a> while developing your DFA class. Unit test classes <a href="https://gouda.msudenver.edu/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=8937&amp;chapterid=90">StateTest.java</a> and <a href="https://gouda.msudenver.edu/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=8937&amp;chapterid=91">DFATest.java</a> utilize the <a href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</a> testing framework. (For those familiar with the Java <strong>assert</strong> mechanism, <a href="https://gouda.msudenver.edu/moodle/mod/book/view.php?id=8937&amp;chapterid=92">DFANonJUnitTest.java</a> defines a more limited test class for DFA that utilizes Javaâ€™s assert rather than JUnit.) I have also provided a <a href="http://jodypaul.com/cs/theory/DFAjava/">full set of javadocs</a>.
